# Weather Bot

A Python-based weather bot that fetches and processes weather data (presumably for chat or automation purposes).

---

##  Repository Structure

- **`main.py`** – Entry point for running the bot.
- **`graph_flow.py`** – Contains logic for the bot's flow or graph-based workflows.
- **`logger.py`** – Configures logging for debugging and monitoring.
- **`app.log`** – Log output file.
- **`state.py`** – Manages state storage (e.g., for user context or sessions).
- **Folders:**
  - **`nodes/`** – Contains modules for bot's modular nodes (e.g., input handlers, data fetchers).
  - **`services/`** – Encapsulates service integrations (like weather API clients).

---

##  Features (Proposed)

- Retrieves weather data from an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) using custom services.
- Structured workflow defined in `graph_flow.py` to handle conversation or bot logic.
- Modular and maintainable architecture with `nodes/` and `services/`.
- Logging support to track execution (`logger.py`) and persisted logs in `app.log`.
- State management for tracking conversations or contexts (`state.py`).

*(Feel free to update based on the specific functionality your bot implements.)*
